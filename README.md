## Rules
- agu-cv environment contains most of the necessary libraries. Please do not install extra packages because TA will not have the package you installed. Your code might not work in that case. If you think there is a useful library that we should use, please let us know so that we can add the package to agu-cv.yml.
- Do not forget to regularly commit your changes to GitHub. We can see your commits. In case of any cheating accusation, we can check your history.
- **Sharing your code is strictly forbidden**. Moreover, be careful when you get a code from internet. If your friend also gets the same code, we consider that as cheating. However, you can talk to your friend, share ideas.
- Write a clean code with comments when relevant. That will help TA.
- Do not use absolute paths in your code. Use relative paths for TA.
## How does this work

- The teacher sends assignment invitations to the students.
- Students connect to their GitHub account and accepts the invitation.
- Students clones the repository to their local machine and start working on it using JupyterLab.
- Students occationally commits their changes.
- After the deadline, TA downloads all student repositories and test them on her/his local machine.
